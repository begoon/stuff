NEW IN VERSION 0.1:
- This release is simply the slightly modified code
- Lots of bug fixes. 
- Quite a few routines replaced with faster ones.
- The beginnings of a "scoreboard" file that stores the pid.

lhttpd is a fast and efficient HTTP server that has CGI support.(no post support, only get)
lhttpd has a small memory inprint and is capable of handling thousands of
simultanious connections. It is ideal for large and small websites. It is
very simple to configure with only a few options to change if changing is
needed at all. You can have lhttpd up and running within two minutes easily
because of its very simple configuration file and installation routine.
ghttpd should run on the majority of UNIX systems but has been developed on
RedHat Linux 7.0, and therefore is known to run on that platform.
lhttpd aims to improve the somewhat "bare bones" ghttpd into a full webserver, 
and an in-built content management system.  Using special SHTML-like tags
named "SPLICE", you will be able to execute in-page MySQL queries, includes and 
echo variables.
Below is the Installation instructions and the usage instructions

This is the windows port of lhttpd, and currently has no CGI support, but works...

LHTTPd is installed to C:\lhttpd and there is an executable in there that should run.
