Initial release. This is just a small proggy useful for debugging
SSL-encrypted protocols. What it does is listening on a specified port,
then upon receiving an incoming connection it connects to the remote
host and operates in the normal way, with the only difference is that
all the traffic is copied to the local stdout. Sshole can serve many
connections at once.
