Initial release. This is just a small proggy useful for debugging
SSL-encrypted protocols. What it does is listening on a specified port,
then upon receiving an incoming connection it connects to the remote
host and operates in the normal way, with the only difference that
all the traffic is copied to the local stdout. Sshole can serve many
connections at once.

SSHole was written by me, Konst as an illustration of OpenSSL
functionality for an article in Software2.0 magazine.

However, besides OpenSSL, SSHole can be built against SSLeay or GnuTLS.

The command line usage can be easily found out by running the program
with no arguments. However, there is a small issue. It requires a
certificate in order to run. This one can be generated easily by
running:

$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem

You can specify the path to the certificate explicitely by using -c
parameter. If the parameter isn't used, the program looks for server.pem
in the current work directory.
