FAQ:

Q:  When I run any .bat file or cmd.exe itself under Winetd, I see an echo of commands! :(

A:  It's well known non-Winetd bug, but a bug of cmd.exe and some other windows utils.

  Winetd is just a "middleware" and by its current self design it CAN NOT add/remove
  anything to/from the stream.

  In the \test\echo dir there is a sample echo server (includes source) that aimed to show
  how to write server applications to run under Winetd.

  Its source is really quite simple:

  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(int argc, char* argv[])
  {
    char ch;
    int  res;

    for(;;)
    {
      res = scanf("%c", &ch);
      if((res == 0) || (res == EOF)) break;
      printf("%c", ch);
    }

    return 0;
  }

-eof-
